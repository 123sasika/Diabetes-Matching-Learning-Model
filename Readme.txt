What the project does,
  * Here is a matching learning model to predict whether person has diabetes or not when we provide some factors releated to that disease. 

The dataset used,
  * Here i have uploaded the dataset that i have used for that. it is a csv file.

The ML techniques applied and overrall summary of the process,
  * Here I used suppervised learning.
  * Here I firstly used Pandas libary to read my dataset(.csv file)
  * Here I did not use any feature engineering techniques so then I simply divided dataset into dependent vatiable and independent variables.
  * Then after i used train_test_split fuction to split taining and testing data and i reserve 30% of data for the testing of the model.
  * Then after I used GaussianNB as the normal distribution.
  * After trainning, the model accuracy is 0.7316017316017316 .
